This is a short list kept by the developer to keep track of features that are still in need of implimentation

1. Finish the Intra Molecular Interaction Framework
2. Finish Rosenbluth Sampling Modules
3. Start work on allowing the user to select different parallelization schemes.
4. Impliment Energy Biased AVBMC
5. CBMC and support for larger molecules is needed.
6. Long Range Solver for bulk systems required.
7. Implimentation of the Stil-Web Potential
8. Pressure Computations for Gibbs and Iso-volumetric Ensembles
9. Finish the EasyPair FF style.

Nice things to think about doing in the future:

1. Internal library for common forcefields.
2. Impliment More Monte Carlo Moves
