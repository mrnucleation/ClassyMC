This is a short list kept by the developer to keep track of features that are still in need of implimentation


1. Finish AE Net Wrapper
2. Finish the Intra Molecular Interaction Framework
3. Finish Rosenbluth Sampling Modules
4. Impliment More Monte Carlo Moves
5. Finish the functions required for Gibb's Ensemble
6. Start work on allowing the user to select different parallelization schemes.
7. Impliment Energy Biased AVBMC and Vanilla AVBMC
8. Screen Output Module needs work.
9. CBMC and support for larger molecules is needed.
10. Long Range Solver for bulk systems required.
11. Python Wrapper coupled with modifications for the script interface.
12. Python Scripts for converting Classy formats to LAMMPS and other common formats.

Nice things to think about doing in the future:

1. Internal library for common forcefields.
